We need our service account json credentials. The json file.  We need to put the json file into the server.

We therefore can use "google sftp" for transfering the files.

Steps to Reproduce:
 cd to home directory where file is located.

 `sftp de-zoomcamp(vm instance name)`

 After connecting mkdir 

 cd into it

 Then `put` the json file there.
